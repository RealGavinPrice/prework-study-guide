# prework-study-guide
A study guide for pre-work orientation

I did this as my prework study guide. Hmm it's the name of the README file! I built it because it was a homework assignment, EVEN THOUGH I also built it because deep within my soul was the need to start to code, and this here is my very very first README file! It solved the problem of my ignorance. I learned the extreme basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while retaining little to nothing.

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
